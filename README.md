# SugarPro

In this ML project I have used XGB algorithm to determine whether a person has diabetes. 
Pregnancy, blood sugar, blood pressure, body mass index, and age are the factors considered. This 
model's accuracy is around 90 percent.
Flask is used to deploy this model and make it accessible to the whole world.
